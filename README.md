# Health_Rish-ML-Project
Developed a logistic regression model to classify patient health risk levels (Low, Medium, High) using vital signs data. Trained on a 1,000‑record dataset with scaled features, achieving 95.5% accuracy. Utilized Python, scikit‑learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to build and visualize a reliable prediction system for healthcare decision support.
